THERE'S ONLY ONE TRUTH
IF YOU SAY STILL I'M DREAMING
YOU'RE ACTING IN A PLAY
YOU CALL YOUR LIFE
THE SKETCH OF FLOWERS ON PAPER・
CAN YOU SMELL THEM?
WELL, I WOULD RATHER BLOOM
FOR ETERNITY
DON'T TALK TO ME
I'M GONNA SUCK AND DRINK
YOUR LIFE RIGHT FROM YOU
NO LIFE IN ME
I'VE GOT NO TIME FOR
CHANGELESS THINGS
AND USELESS THINGS
WHICH ONE'S THE REAL FACE
OF THE SKY, DAY OR NIGHT?
HOW DO YOU THINK?
UH...I SUPPOSE IT'S BOTH
IT'S CONTRADICTING
THE NATURE OF EXISTENCE
IT'S SOMEWHERE
I MUST GO WITHOUT DELAY
GOOD BYE MY SUNSHINE
GOOD BYE MY DARKEST DAYS
CAUSE I HAVE JUST WASTED
MY LIFE AWAY
I'M MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE
HELLO
I'M GONNA SUCK AND DRINK
YOUR LIFE RIGHT FROM YOU
DON'T COME NEAR ME
NOW IT IS TIME TO RECOGNIZE
WHEN YOU'VE CROSSED THE BAR
I AM DEAD
